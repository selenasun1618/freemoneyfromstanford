The fellowship fosters collaboration between engineers, social scientists, humanists, and others researching the future of purposeful, intentional, and human-centered AI. HAI graduate fellows will: Participate in mandatory bi-weekly seminars with HAI Affiliated Faculty, guest speakers, HAI postdocs, and fellow cohort members. Participate in events with other HAI Fellows (i.e., paper/proposal workshops, practice job talks, training opportunities, and socials). Contribute to a final group project (i.e., poster session, blog post, student-led event) Be located on campus for all 3 quarters during AY 2024-2025 (fall, winter, spring) The fellowship will pay $1,000 per quarter.",

In the spirit of cross-disciplinary collaboration and community building, fellows will also be required to engage in HAI programming to develop the skills necessary to further their research, careers, and the mission of HAI: advancing AI research, education, policy, and practice to improve the human condition. HAI will be seeking postdoctoral applicants from all areas of research related to artificial intelligence, spanning theoretical foundations, systems, software, applications, design, and social impact. HAI is particularly interested in applicants doing research at the frontiers of artificial intelligence with other disciplines, including but not limited to the humanities, business, education, law, medicine, and physical and social sciences.",

Along these lines, we seek proposals that support new, ambitious, and speculative ideas with the objective of getting initial results. We welcome proposals from the whole array of humanistic, social scientific, natural scientific, biomedical, and engineering approaches, including critical, historical, ethnographic, clinical, experimental, and inventive work from discrete studies to research for book publications to speaker series to system building and evaluation. We especially aim to fund collaborations of faculty and students whose work bridges two or more disciplines and proposals that can make a persuasive case that these initial results will catalyze further support from internal and external stakeholders. We expect to award approximately 25 grants, up to $75,000 each for a one-year period. HAI and the Center for Artificial Intelligence in Medicine & Imaging (AIMI) are simultaneously offering a separate funding opportunity, a joint call for proposals up to $200,000 for two years. Additional guidance on which funding source is most appropriate for your project, and other frequently asked questions, can be found here. You cannot submit the same research for both opportunities; however, the review committee may forward proposals submitted for the HAI general call for consideration to the HAI-AIMI call.",

For example, the cancer incidence rate for all cancers combined is lower among Black women and men compared to non-Hispanic White women and men, but death rates are higher. The Stanford Cancer Institute (SCI), Office of Cancer Health Equity is pleased to offer a call for cancer health equity proposals. Applicants can respond to one or more of the tracks outlined below. The Stanford Cancer Institute serves Santa Clara, San Mateo, Santa Cruz, Alameda, Contra Costa, Monterey, San Benito, San Joaquin, Stanislaus, and Merced counties, prioritizing lung, breast, pancreatic, liver, and lymphoma cancers. For both tracks, we welcome proposals that focus on these counties and priority cancers in addition to the incorporation of data collection and/or analysis component. Challenge awards will be granted for 2 years and up to $100,000. Seed grant awards will be granted for 1 year and up to $50,000.",
